### Important Notes that are needed for the service nodes in Node-RED editor:

* Copy and paste into one place all usernames, passwords and hosts of all services for easy access when needed
* `These credentials will be used in the Node-RED editor for each service node, without them your app will not behave as intended in this turorial`
* Each service will automatically create its credentials: `Username` and `Password`
* If you don't see the service credentials, you can create a new one: `Create Credentials`
* Internet of Things Platform will require to create an `api key` and `api token`. There's an how-to guide included on [IoT page](iot.md).
* For the missing nodes (dashed), click on: `Burger Menu` -> `Manage Palette` -> `Install`
  <br>Then, type in the search field (search modules) to install the `microphone`, `play-audio`, `bluemix-dashboard`
